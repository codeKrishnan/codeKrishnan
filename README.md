- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @codeKrishnan. I am a passionate Android developer.Doing Android developement for the past 2+ years. I do end to end app developement from the initial commit to deploying it on the play console.

- ðŸ‘€ I follow SOLID principle.I love Kotlin, Jetpack compose and MVVM. I hate looking at code which is not properly packaged or is lingering in the codebase without properlly defined scope, responsibility and doesn't have proper sepeation of concern.I love fixing architecture, writing UI and whatelse, oh... coroutines.
- ðŸŒ± I am still learning and will always be.
